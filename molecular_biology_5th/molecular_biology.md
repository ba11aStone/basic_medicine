# A Brief History #

## Transmission Genetics ##

### Mendel's Laws of Inheritance ###

Mendel saw that a gene can exist in different forms called alleles.

Homozygotes have two copies of the same allele; heterozygotes have one copy of each allele.

  > One allele can be dominant over another, so heterozygotes having two different alleles of one gene will generally exhibit the characteristic dictated by the dominant allele.

### The Chromosome Theory of Inheritance ###

Mendel had predicted that gametes would contain only one allele of each gene instead of two.

### Genetic Recombination and Mapping ###

### Physical Evidence for Recombination ###

## Molecular Genetics ##

### The Discovery of DNA ###

### The Relationship Between Genes and Proteins ###

Such sequences of reactions are called pathways, and the products or substrates within a pathway are called intermediates.

### Activities of Genes ###

#### How Genes Are Replicated ####

semiconservative replication

#### How Genes Direct the Production of Polypeptides ####

The ribosomes are nonspecific translation machines that can make an unlimited number of different proteins, according to the instructions in the mRNAs that visit the ribosomes.

#### How Genes Accumulate Mutation ####

#### Gene Cloning ####

## The Three Domains of Life ##

# The Molecular Nature of Genes #

## The Nature of Genetic Material ##

### Transformation in Bacteria ###

Genes are made of DNA.

### The Chemical Nature of Polynucleotides ###

* adenine
* cytosine
* guanine
* thymine
* uracil

The subunits of DNA and RNA are nucleotides.

## DNA Structure ##

### Experimental Background ###

### The Double Helix ###

An adenine-thymine base pair held together by hydrogen bonds has almost exactly the same shape as a guanine-cytosine base pair.

The doulbe helix is presented in three ways.

There are about 10 base pairs (bp) per turn of the helix.

## Genes Made of RNA ##

Certain viruses contain genes made of RNA instead of DNA.

## Physical Chemistry of Nucleic Acids ##

### A Variety of DNA Structures ###

The plane of a base pair is no longer roughly perpendicular to the helical axis, but tilts 20 degrees away from horizontal.

Both the A and B form DNA structures are right-handed.

#### Separating the Two Strands of a DNA Double Helix ####

The temperature at which the DNA strands are half denatured is called the melting temperature, or $T_m$ .

The higher a DNA's GC content, the higher its $T_m$ .

> Low ionic strength, high pH, and organic solvents also promote DNA denaturation.

#### Reuniting the Separated DNA Strands ####

Once the two strands of DNA separate, they can, under the proper conditions, come back together again. This is called annealing or renaturation.

1. Temperature
2. DNA Concentration
3. Renaturation Time

#### Hybridization of Two Different Polynucleotide Chains ####

### DNAs of Various Sizes and Shapes ###

#### The Relationship Between DNA Size and Genetic Capacity ####

An average protein has a molecular mass of about 40,000 D. The molecular masses of amino acids average about 110 D. A protein containing 364 amino acids needs a gene of about 1092 bp.

#### DNA Content and the C-Value Paradox ####

### Protein Structure ###

1. primary structure
2. secondary structure
3. tertiary structure
4. quaternary structure

### Protein Function ###

1. provide the structure
2. to carry signals
3. bind and carry substances
4. control the activities
5. serve as enzymes to catalyze

#### The Relationship Between Genes and Proteins ####

Each enzyme in a biochemical pathway is controlled by one gene.

* overlapping genes
* genes-within-genes
* fragmented genes

### Discovery of Messenger RNA ###

ribosomes are constant.

mRNA, not rRNA, is the informational molecule.

> Messenger RNAs carry the genetic information from the genes to the ribosomes, which synthesize polypeptides.

### Transcription ###

1. *Initiation*

At least 12 bp are melted. The first, or initiating, substrate is usually a purine nucleotide.

2. *Elongation*

RNA polymerase makes only one RNA strand during transcription.

3. *Termination*

RNA is made in a 5'-3' direction.

### Translation ###

#### Ribosomes: Protein-Synthesizing Machines ####

The number 50S and 30S refer to the sedimentation coefficients of the two subunits.

rRNAs participate in protein synthesis but do not code for proteins.

#### Transfer RNA: The Adapter Molecule ####

Such a triplet in mRNA is called a codon.

#### Initiation of Protein Synthesis ####

> AUG is usually the initiating codon.

#### Translation Elongation ####

#### Termination of Translation and mRNA Structure ####

The initiation codon at one end, and the termination codon at the other end of a coding region of a gene identify an open reading frame (ORF).

Transcription and translation do not start and stop at the same places.

## Replication ##

DNA really dose replicate by a semiconservative mechanism.

## Mutations ##

Mutation is essential for evolution.

### Sickle Cell Disease ###

> A change in a gene can cause a corresponding change in the protein product of that gene.

# Molecular Cloning Methods #

## Gene Cloning ##

### The Role of Restriction Endonucleases ###

The first letter is the first letter of the genus and the next two letters are the first two letters of the species.

Py stands for either of the pyrimidines (T or C), and Pu stands for either purine (A or G).

A 6-bp cutter will yield DNA fragments of average length about 4000 bp, or 4 kilobases (4kb). (4^6=4096)

We call such enzymes that recognize different sites in identical sequences heteroschizomers or neoschizomers, that cut at the same site in the same sequence isoschizomers.

They are identical after rotating them 180 degrees. Sequences with twofold symmetry are also called palindromes.

### Vectors ###

#### Plasmids as Vectors ####

#### Phages as Vectors ####

They infect cells much more efficiently than plasmids transform cells.

#### λ Phage Vectors ####

they can accommodate much more foreign DNA.
a minimum size requirement for their inserts.

An ideal probe would be a labeled nucleic acid.

#### Cosmids ####

#### M13 Phage Vectors ####

The genome of this phage is a single-stranded DNA.

#### Phagemids ####

They have characteristics of both phages and plasmids.

> Two kinds of phages have been especially popular as cloning vectors.
> 1. λ
> 2. the M13 phages

#### Eukaryotic Vectors and Very High Capacity Vectors ####

### Identifying a Specific Clone with a Specific Probe ###

1. polynucleotides (or oligonucleotides)
2. antibodies

#### Polynucleotide Probes ####

use more than one oligonucleotide
most amino acids are encoded by more than one triplet codon.

### cDNA Cloning ###

A cDNA (complementary DNA or copy DNA) is a DNA copy of an RNA, usually an mRNA.

Reverse transcriptase is like any other DNA-synthesizing enzyme in that it cannot initiate DNA synthesis without a primer.

using the first strand as the template.

### Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends ###

## The Polymerase Chain Reaction ##

### Standard PCR ###

to make a copy of a selected region of DNA.
it usually takes fewer than 20 cycles.

### Using Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in cDNA Cloning ###

start with an mRNA instead of a double-stranded DNA.

the cDNA itself has neither of the restriction sites that have been added to its ends.

> The sequence of the mRNA must be known so the primers for the PCR step can be signed.

### Real-Time PCR ###

quantifying the amplification in real time.

> measured in real time in a fluorimeter.

## Methods of Expressing Cloned Genes ##

1. to produce large quantities of particular DNA sequences
2. to make a large quantity of the gene's product

### Expression Vectors ###

#### Inducible Expression Vectors ####

The more mRNA that is produced, the more protein product will be made.

#### Expression Vectors That Produce Fusion Proteins ####

purifying the protein product.

#### Eukaryotic Expression Systems ####

the gene can be expressed in a eukaryotic cell. using a shuttle vector that can replicate in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells.

the term *transfected* with eukaryotic cells instead of *transformed*, which we use with bacteria.
We use transfection to denote introducing new DNA into a eukaryotic cell.

> 1. Eukaryotic proteins made in eukaryotic cells tend to be folded properly.
> 2. Eukaryotic proteins made in eukaryotic cells are modified (phosphorylated, glycosylated, etc.) in a eukaryotic manner.

### Other Eukaryotic Vectors ###

### Using the Ti Plasmid to Transfer Genes to Plants ###

> To clone a gene, one must insert it into a vector that can carry the gene into a host cell and ensure that it will replicate there.

# Molecular Tools for Studying Genes and Gene Activity #

## Molecular Separations ##

### Gel Electrophoresis ###

The DNA is negatively charged because of the phophates in its backbone, so it magrates toward the positive pole (the anode) at the end of the gel.

the largest near the top, the smallest near the bottom.

Any unknown DNA can be electrophoresed in parallel with the standard fragments.

PFGE: pulsed-field gel electrophoresis

PAGE: polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. treat the protein usually with sodium dodecyl sulfate, or SDS. (SDS-PAGE)

| nucleic acid | agarose        |
| protein      | polyacrylamide |

### Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis ###

### Ion-Exchange Chromatography ###

Ion-exchange chromatography uses a resin to separate substances according to their charges.

DEAE: diethyl-aminoethyl

These positive charges attract negatively charged substances.

### Gel Filtration Chromatography ###

separates molecules based on their physical dimensions (protein size).

Large molecules will emerge first from the column, and small molecules will emerge last.

### Affinity Chromatography ###

That molecule binds to a column coupled to the affinity reagent but all or most other molecules flow through without binding. Then the molecule of interest can be eluted from the column with a solution of a substance that disrupts the specific binding.

## Labeled Tracers ##

### Autoradiography ###

If the band is very dark, it will absorb most of the light.

### Phosphorimaging ###

It is much more accurate in quantifying the amount of radioactivity in a substance.

dpm: disintegrations per minute

### Liquid Scintillation Counting ###

convers the invisible radioactivity into visible light.

cpm: counts per minute

### Nonradioactive Tracers ###

> Those that produce colored products can be detected directly, by observing the appearance of colored spots.

## Using Nucleic Acid Hybridization ##

### Southern Blots: Identifying Specific DNA Fragments ###

A labeled probe will be hybridized to these bands to see how many of them contain coding sequences for the gene of interest.

One gene can give more than one band if it contains one or more cutting sites for the restriction enzyme used.

### DNA Fingerprinting and DNA Typing ###

individuals differ in the pattern of repeats of the basic sequence.

### Forensic Uses of DNA Fingerprinting and DNA Typing ###

### In Situ Hybridization: Locating Genes in Chromosomes ###

FISH: fluorescence in situ hybridization

> to locate genes or other specific DNA sequences.

### Immunoblots (Western Blots) ###

electrophoresis of proteins instead of nucleic acids.

> Proteins are electrophoresed, then blotted to a membrane.
