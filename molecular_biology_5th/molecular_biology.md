# A Brief History #

## Transmission Genetics ##

### Mendel's Laws of Inheritance ###

Mendel saw that a gene can exist in different forms called alleles.

Homozygotes have two copies of the same allele; heterozygotes have one copy of each allele.

  > One allele can be dominant over another, so heterozygotes having two different alleles of one gene will generally exhibit the characteristic dictated by the dominant allele.

### The Chromosome Theory of Inheritance ###

Mendel had predicted that gametes would contain only one allele of each gene instead of two.

### Genetic Recombination and Mapping ###

### Physical Evidence for Recombination ###

## Molecular Genetics ##

### The Discovery of DNA ###

### The Relationship Between Genes and Proteins ###

Such sequences of reactions are called pathways, and the products or substrates within a pathway are called intermediates.

### Activities of Genes ###

#### How Genes Are Replicated ####

semiconservative replication

#### How Genes Direct the Production of Polypeptides ####

The ribosomes are nonspecific translation machines that can make an unlimited number of different proteins, according to the instructions in the mRNAs that visit the ribosomes.

#### How Genes Accumulate Mutation ####

#### Gene Cloning ####

## The Three Domains of Life ##

* bacteria
* eukaryota
* archaea

# The Molecular Nature of Genes #

## The Nature of Genetic Material ##

### Transformation in Bacteria ###

Genes are made of DNA.

### The Chemical Nature of Polynucleotides ###

* adenine
* cytosine
* guanine
* thymine
* uracil

The subunits of DNA and RNA are nucleotides.

## DNA Structure ##

### Experimental Background ###

### The Double Helix ###

An adenine-thymine base pair held together by hydrogen bonds has almost exactly the same shape as a guanine-cytosine base pair.

The doulbe helix is presented in three ways.

There are about 10 base pairs (bp) per turn of the helix.

## Genes Made of RNA ##

Certain viruses contain genes made of RNA instead of DNA.

## Physical Chemistry of Nucleic Acids ##

### A Variety of DNA Structures ###

The plane of a base pair is no longer roughly perpendicular to the helical axis, but tilts 20 degrees away from horizontal.

Both the A and B form DNA structures are right-handed.

#### Separating the Two Strands of a DNA Double Helix ####

The temperature at which the DNA strands are half denatured is called the melting temperature, or $T_m$ .

The higher a DNA's GC content, the higher its $T_m$ .

> Low ionic strength, high pH, and organic solvents also promote DNA denaturation.

#### Reuniting the Separated DNA Strands ####

Once the two strands of DNA separate, they can, under the proper conditions, come back together again. This is called annealing or renaturation.

1. Temperature
2. DNA Concentration
3. Renaturation Time

#### Hybridization of Two Different Polynucleotide Chains ####

### DNAs of Various Sizes and Shapes ###

#### The Relationship Between DNA Size and Genetic Capacity ####

An average protein has a molecular mass of about 40,000 D. The molecular masses of amino acids average about 110 D. A protein containing 364 amino acids needs a gene of about 1092 bp.

### Protein Structure ###

1. primary structure
2. secondary structure
3. tertiary structure
4. quaternary structure

### Protein Function ###

1. provide the structure
2. to carry signals
3. bind and carry substances
4. control the activities
5. serve as enzymes to catalyze

#### The Relationship Between Genes and Proteins ####

Each enzyme in a biochemical pathway is controlled by one gene.

* overlapping genes
* genes-within-genes
* fragmented genes

### Discovery of Messenger RNA ###

ribosomes are constant.

mRNA, not rRNA, is the informational molecule.

> Messenger RNAs carry the genetic information from the genes to the ribosomes, which synthesize polypeptides.

### Transcription ###

1. *Initiation*

At least 12 bp are melted. The first, or initiating, substrate is usually a purine nucleotide.

2. *Elongation*

RNA polymerase makes only one RNA strand during transcription.

3. *Termination*

RNA is made in a 5'-3' direction.

### Translation ###

#### Ribosomes: Protein-Synthesizing Machines ####

The number 50S and 30S refer to the sedimentation coefficients of the two subunits.

rRNAs participate in protein synthesis but do not code for proteins.

#### Transfer RNA: The Adapter Molecule ####

Such a triplet in mRNA is called a codon.

#### Initiation of Protein Synthesis ####

> AUG is usually the initiating codon.

#### Translation Elongation ####

#### Termination of Translation and mRNA Structure ####

The initiation codon at one end, and the termination codon at the other end of a coding region of a gene identify an open reading frame (ORF).

Transcription and translation do not start and stop at the same places.
